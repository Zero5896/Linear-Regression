# Linear Regression Analysis

Welcome to the Linear Regression Analysis project! This repository provides a hands-on demonstration of linear regression techniques using Python. It's my first take on understanding and learning linear regression through various exercises, where I explore different methods and dataframes, including residual analysis, normality tests, and model evaluation techniques.

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Import and preprocess data for analysis.
- **Model Training and Prediction**: Train a linear regression model and make predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics, such as RMSE and RÂ².
- **Visualizations**: Create visual representations of data, regression lines, and residuals.
- **Normality Check**: Validate the distribution of residuals using statistical tests and visualizations.

## Files

### Main Notebooks
- `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Analysis of a single dataset (`Salary.csv`), including linear regression and residual analysis.
- `Multiple_datasets.ipynb`: Exploration of multiple datasets, applying various regression techniques and evaluation metrics.

### Data
- `data/Salary.csv`: The primary dataset used for linear regression analysis.
- `data/ansc.csv`: Additional datasets for extended regression exercises.

### Results
- **Visuals for Salary Data:**
  - Scatter plots, linear regression fits, residuals, and density plots for various models and data subsets.
- **Visuals for Additional Datasets:**
  - Similar analysis and visualizations for multiple datasets, stored in a structured manner.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
